### Likely Working (Need User Confirmation):

- **Drag & drop** - Registered for file drops
- **Recent files menu** - Code exists

## ‚ùå Features That DON'T Work

### Not Applicable (It's a viewer!):
- **Save/Save As** - Not needed for a viewer

### Architectural Fiction:
- **GPU acceleration** - Using NSTextView
- **Virtual DOM** - Exists but unused
- **SIMD optimization** - Never used
- **Memory pools** - Not used for parsing

## üéØ Discovery: Hidden Features!

We discovered that many features were **already implemented but not documented**:

1. **Search was 100% complete** - Just needed testing
2. **File watching appears functional** - Auto-reload on external changes
3. **Command Palette exists** - SimpleCommandPalette implementation

## üìä Real Statistics

- **Features claimed**: ~20
- **Actually working**: ~10 (50%)
- **Hidden but working**: ~3 (15%)
- **Broken**: ~7 (35%)

## Next Steps

1. Document the working features properly
2. Test Command Palette thoroughly
3. Wire up TOC sidebar (parser works, UI exists)
4. Add Export to PDF (macOS makes this easy)
