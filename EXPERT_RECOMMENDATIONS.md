# Expert Recommendations for Inkwell

## Executive Summary
Two world-renowned experts (Sr. Principal Software Engineer, 25 years; Creative Director, 20 years) have reviewed Inkwell and provided brutally honest feedback.

**Core Finding:** Stop adding features. Fix fundamentals. Delete unnecessary code.

## Sr. Principal Software Engineer's Assessment

### Critical Issues
- 10 unimplemented menu actions (Export PDF, Export HTML, Zoom controls)
- 4,000-line main.mm file becoming unmaintainable
- Performance monitoring code that doesn't actually monitor
- No virtualization for large files (app freezes on 10MB markdown)
- Search is just Cmd+F in NSTextView (inadequate)

### Key Quote
> "You have 15,000 lines of code. 5,000 are effects nobody uses. 10 are the PDF export you haven't written. Which matters more?"

## Creative Director's Assessment

### Critical Issues
- 5,000+ lines of unnecessary effects code (ripple, particle, physics)
- No window restoration
- No recent files menu
- No session memory (last file, scroll position)
- Poor first-launch experience
- Generic app icon in dock

### Key Quote
> "Every second spent on particle effects is a second not spent on making text beautiful and readable. You're not a game. You're a reading tool."

## Consensus Roadmap

### PHASE 1: Fix Broken Shit (1 week)
```
□ Implement PDF export (30 minutes)
□ Implement HTML export (30 minutes)
□ Fix window restoration (2 hours)
□ Add recent files menu (1 hour)
□ Remember last opened file (30 minutes)
□ Implement zoom controls (1 hour)
□ Remove or hide unimplemented menu items
```

### PHASE 2: Performance (1 week)
```
□ Profile loading of large files
□ Implement progressive rendering for files > 1MB
□ Add file size warnings for files > 10MB
□ Optimize attributed string generation
□ Cache rendered output
```

### PHASE 3: Core Features (2 weeks)
```
□ Real document search with highlighting
□ Reading progress indicator
□ Reading time estimation
□ Session restoration (file + scroll position)
□ Welcome document for first launch
```

### PHASE 4: Delete Code (1 day)
```
□ Remove ALL effects except one simple one
□ Remove debug overlays
□ Remove performance monitoring that doesn't work
□ Consolidate main.mm (4000 → 2000 lines)
```

## Implementation Priority (Do First)

1. **Export as PDF** - It's in the menu. Make it work.
2. **Large file handling** - Test with 10MB markdown file
3. **Window persistence** - Remember size/position
4. **Recent files** - Standard macOS behavior
5. **Delete effects code** - All of it except one

---

## Success Metrics

- Binary size stays under 600KB
- 10MB file loads in < 1 second
- Window restoration works 100% of time
- All menu items either work or are removed
- Code reduced by 5,000+ lines

## The Bottom Line

**STOP ADDING FEATURES. FIX WHAT'S BROKEN. POLISH WHAT EXISTS.**

The best code is the code you don't write.
