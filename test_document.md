# Test Document - Inkwell Functionality Check

## The Moment of Truth

This is a **test** to see if we can actually render *markdown* text instead of colored rectangles.

### Key Questions:
1. Can we see this text?
2. Is it formatted properly?
3. Are headers visible?

```javascript
// Can we see code blocks?
function test() {
    return "Hello, World!";
}
```

> "If you can read this quote, we're making progress!"

- [ ] Text is visible (not rectangles)
- [ ] Basic formatting works
- [ ] Headers are distinct
- [ ] Code blocks are formatted
- [ ] Lists work

If you can read all of this, **Inkwell is working correctly!**
