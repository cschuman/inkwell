# Drag & Drop Effects - Critical Bug Fix

## The Critical Bug (Found through Deep Analysis)

The `renderToView:` method in all effects had this fatal flaw:

```objc
// WRONG - Only executes when targetView changes!
- (void)renderToView:(NSView*)view {
    if (self.targetView != view) {  // <-- THIS WAS THE BUG
        self.targetView = view;
        // ...add overlays...
    }
}
```

### Why This Failed:
1. First drag: targetView is nil → gets set to view → overlays added ✓
2. Second drag: targetView already equals view → entire block skipped → NO OVERLAYS ✗

## The Fix

Changed to ALWAYS update the view hierarchy:

```objc
// CORRECT - Always ensures overlays are added if needed
- (void)renderToView:(NSView*)view {
    self.targetView = view;  // Always update
    
    // Add overlay if not already there
    if (self.baseOverlay && self.baseOverlay.superview != view) {
        [view addSubview:self.baseOverlay positioned:NSWindowBelow relativeTo:nil];
    }
    // ... etc
}
```

## Changes Made:
1. ✅ NoEffect: Fixed renderToView to always check/add overlay
2. ✅ RippleEffect: Fixed renderToView, removed targetView check
3. ✅ ParticleEffect: Fixed renderToView, removed targetView check
4. ✅ Added proper memory management (release + nil in cleanup)
5. ✅ Added debug logging to track execution

## Test Now With:
```bash
./test_drag_final.sh
```

Watch for these debug messages:
- "DragEntered: Markdown file detected"
- "NoEffect: Creating overlay view"
- "NoEffect: Adding overlay to view"

The effects should now work on EVERY drag, not just the first one!
