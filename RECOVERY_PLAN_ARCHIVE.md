# 🔧 Operation: Unfuck Inkwell - Recovery Plan

## Mission Statement
Stop playing architecture astronaut. Start shipping working software.

## Current Reality Check
- **What we have**: Over-engineered architecture with no working text rendering
- **What we need**: A markdown viewer that displays actual text
- **Project actual completion**: 15% (not the claimed 65%)

---

## PHASE 1: GET SOMETHING ON SCREEN (Week 1)
**Goal: See actual markdown text rendered, even if ugly**

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Bypass the Metal renderer completely**
   - Use NSTextView for all text rendering
   - Comment out Metal rendering code
   - Disable glyph atlas system

2. **Create dead-simple markdown rendering**
   - Markdown → NSAttributedString converter
   - Support only: headers, bold, italic, code blocks
   - Ignore virtual DOM completely

3. **Rip out broken features**
   - Remove focus mode/vignette effects
   - Disable command palette if broken
   - Comment out all stub menu items

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Can open a .md file
- [ ] Can see formatted text (not rectangles)
- [ ] Can scroll without crashing

---

## PHASE 2: MAKE IT BUILD (Days 1-2)

### Build System Fixes:
```bash
# Simplified build script
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. -DSKIP_TESTS=ON -DSKIP_METAL=ON
make -j8
```

### Add CMake Options:
```cmake
option(ENABLE_METAL_RENDERING "Enable Metal rendering" OFF)
option(ENABLE_VIRTUAL_DOM "Enable virtual DOM" OFF)
option(ENABLE_MEMORY_POOLS "Enable custom memory pools" OFF)
```

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] App launches without crashing
- [ ] No dependency issues

---

## PHASE 3: MINIMUM VIABLE VIEWER (Week 2)

### Core Features ONLY:
1. ✅ Open .md files
2. ✅ Display formatted text  
3. ✅ Scroll
4. ✅ Close/quit properly

### Explicitly NOT Doing:
- ❌ GPU acceleration
- ❌ Custom memory management
- ❌ Virtual DOM diffing
- ❌ Command palette
- ❌ Vim navigation
- ❌ Focus mode
- ❌ Reading time badges
- ❌ Any other fancy features

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Can use as daily markdown viewer
- [ ] No crashes in normal use
- [ ] Performance acceptable for files under 1MB

---

## PHASE 4: INCREMENTAL FEATURES (Weeks 3-4)

### Feature Priority (implement ONE at a time):
1. **File watching/auto-reload** (mostly done)
2. **Table of Contents navigation** (80% complete)
3. **Basic find/search**
4. **Export to PDF** (use system print)

### For Each Feature:
- Build completely
- Test thoroughly
- Ship it
- THEN move to next feature

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Each feature works end-to-end
- [ ] No partially implemented features
- [ ] User can rely on what's there

---

## PHASE 5: PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION (Month 2+)
**Only after shipping and getting user feedback**

### Conditional Performance:
```cpp
if (document.size() > LARGE_FILE_THRESHOLD) {
    // Consider virtual DOM
} else {
    // Keep simple NSTextView
}
```

### Gradual Metal Migration:
- Start with rendering headers only
- Measure actual performance gain
- Keep NSTextView as permanent fallback

---

## 30-Day Timeline

| Days | Focus | Deliverable |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1-3 | NSTextView rendering | Text visible on screen |
| 4-5 | Build system | Clean build, no errors |
| 6-10 | File operations | Open/save working |
| 11-15 | File watching | Auto-reload on changes |
| 16-20 | TOC navigation | Click to jump |
| 21-25 | Search | Find text in document |
| 26-30 | Polish & docs | Honest README, testing |
| 31 | **SHIP v0.1.0** | **Working app released** |

---

## Hard Rules

### Architecture Rules:
1. **Delete broken code** - Don't comment "for later", delete it
2. **NSTextView is fine** - Ship with it, optimize later if needed
3. **No new features** until current ones work completely
4. **No performance optimization** until users complain

### Documentation Rules:
1. Remove all false performance claims
2. Change version to 0.1.0
3. Add "Early Development" warning
4. List only features that actually work

### Development Rules:
1. **One feature at a time**
2. **Test manually before moving on**
3. **Prefer simple over clever**
4. **Ship weekly builds**

---

## Success Metrics

### Week 1 Success:
- Text renders ✅
- No crashes ✅
- Can open files ✅

### Month 1 Success:
- Daily usable ✅
- 5 core features working ✅
- Honest documentation ✅
- Version 0.1.0 shipped ✅

### What We're NOT Measuring:
- Performance benchmarks ❌
- Memory usage ❌
- GPU utilization ❌
- Architecture purity ❌

## Recovery Mantras

> "Shipped beats perfect"

> "Working beats clever"  

> "Users beat architecture"

> "Simple now, sophisticated later"

> "Delete the clever code"

---

## Current Status Tracking

### Completed:
- [ ] Recovery plan created

### In Progress:
- [ ] Nothing yet

### Blocked:
- [ ] Nothing yet

## Notes/Decisions Log

**Date: 2025-08-18**
- Created recovery plan after brutal assessment
- Decision: Abandon Metal rendering temporarily
- Decision: Use NSTextView as primary renderer
- Decision: Reset version to 0.1.0

Remember: The goal isn't to build the world's most sophisticated markdown viewer. It's to build a markdown viewer that someone will actually use.
